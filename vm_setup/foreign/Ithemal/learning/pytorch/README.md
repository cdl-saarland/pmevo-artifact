# Structure

This folder contains all files related to Ithemal's learning process.

Following folders contains the core of Ithemal.

* models - neural network models
* data - preparing data for consumption by neural networks
* ithemal - the main driver files which can be used to train and validate Ithemal

Other folders test different models and summarize statistics.

* experiments - lists most of the experiments with different neural network models and different tasks
* stats - creates graphs and validation results for human consumption (as well as for the paper)
* word2vec - for generating word2vec embeddings

Inputs and results folders hold input data, models, embeddings for Ithemal and results of running Ithemal.
